# 📊 Sales Insights & Profit Analysis for an Imaginary Indian Company (MySQL, Tableau)

This **Sales Insights** project, which takes the point of view of an imaginary Indian company aiming to **understand why sales have been declining, in order to boost them**, is an end-to-end data analysis pipeline, leveraging **MySQL** for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **data cleaning**, followed by **Tableau** for **visualization**. The project delivers **dynamic dashboards** to analyze **revenue and profit trends** across different markets, customer types, and product categories.



## 📌 SQL Data Cleaning & EDA Steps
- **Total transactions and customers count.**
- **Filtering transactions by city** (e.g., Chennai).
- **Identifying transactions in non-INR currencies and converting USD to INR.**
- **Revenue and transaction analysis by year.**
- **Removing irrelevant data** (Paris, New York markets).
